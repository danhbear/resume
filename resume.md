## Background

I'm a software developer with an interest in user-facing products and services. I enjoy building and prototyping things quickly. My ideal is to work across a variety of components and technologies -- apps, sites, and services.

Lately I've been using C#, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, Python, and Objective-C, but I have experience in Ruby, Java, ActionScript, C/C++, and SQL. I'm currently working on news and social content experiences for mobile and desktop. Previously I focused on video navigation and playback applications for living room devices.

I strive to be an independent worker and capable leader. When I have free time, I enjoy family, playing guitar, cooking, taking my dogs hiking, and reading fiction.
